# Design Note: Human-Centered Conversational AI

## Motivation
While observing how large language models attempt to understand human language, I became increasingly aware of the gap between pattern recognition and genuine comprehension. Human understanding is shaped by empathy, lived experience, intuition, and context—elements that are difficult to encode directly into artificial systems.

This project began as an exploration of how AI systems might be guided by human values rather than optimized solely for task completion.

## Core Idea
The system is designed to assist rather than replace human judgment. Instead of attempting to simulate empathy, it acknowledges its limitations and focuses on supporting users through contextual awareness, controlled memory, and emotionally sensitive responses.

## Memory as a Design Choice
Memory is treated as intentional rather than automatic. The system distinguishes between short-term conversational context and long-term information, with explicit forgetting mechanisms to avoid retaining unnecessary or sensitive data.

## Role of the Human
Human direction remains central. The AI does not decide what is important to remember or how to interpret emotional nuance beyond surface signals. These decisions are framed as design responsibilities guided by human values.

## Reflection
This project reflects my interest in the intersection of human intelligence and artificial intelligence—not as competing systems, but as complementary ones. The goal is not to create AI that feels human, but AI that respects what it means to be human.
